# Final Project for CS336 - Tic Tac Toe

## Vision Statement

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe raises the strategy of normal tic-tac-toe to greater heights! 
With a 3x3 board of tic-tac-toe games, two opponents face off to achieve three games won in a row.
Nevertheless, opponents do not play games in sequence. Rather, they play all of the games at once!
How is this possible? When playerX marks a small tic-tac-toe board, playerO must switch to the corresponding small tic-tac-toe board and mark a circle there. 
Then, when playerO has marked his or her small tic-tac-toe board, playerX must switch to the board that matches playerO's circle placement. 
When a small tic-tac-toe board has been completed, neither player may mark that game. 
Instead, if a player encounters a completed small game, that player gets to play on any open game. 
Thanks to the power of ReactJS, Webpack, MongoDB, and ReactRouter, NinjaMarshmallow and Littlesnowman88 have made a single page application for ultimate tic-tac-toe.
Enjoy!
